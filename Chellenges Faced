ADXL375 Accelerometer wouldn’t work, later discovered internal logic of it needed additional power.

Existing Models achieved poor accuracy scores (around 50%) on training data when confined to 1 channel.

I had to teach myself how to make deep learning models
CNN model was stuck at 66%, eventually pushed it to 70%
CNN won’t go past 7-, after months of fine tuning got it to 72

Finally had access to 4 channels thanks to Muse2 and achieved 76% accuracy

Model training took hours so I had to be precise in how I trained the models

Neurosky Mindwave software didn’t work for ARM.
Neurosky Mindwave didn’t connect to RPi

MuseLSL didn’t work on ARM, it worked for x86 windows but not ARM
MuseLSL2 found and finally worked
