Real-Time Field Concussion Detection System

Introduction:
Brief:
Concussions are a major health concern, particularly in sports, with approximately 3.8 million sports-related concussions occurring annually in the US. This project aims to improve concussion detection by integrating accelerometers and EEG monitoring into a wearable helmet.

Problem:
Concussions are a major concern in sports and recreational activities, with approximately 3.8 million sports-related concussions occurring annually in the US. These injuries can lead to long-term cognitive, behavioral, and emotional issues if not detected early. Current detection methods rely mainly on visible symptoms or reported impact forces, leaving a critical gap in real-time concussion monitoring. Additionally, studies show that 30% to 50% of sports-related concussions are not reported immediately, often due to a lack of awareness, the fear of losing playtime, or misconceptions about the severity of the injury. This delay in reporting further complicates timely diagnosis and treatment.

Goal:
My goal was to develop a helmet equipped with accelerometers and EEG sensors to detect concussions by measuring impact forces and abnormal brain activity, thereby ensuring timely medical intervention and improved safety. While initially targeted towards athletes, this technology could also benefit children riding bikes, roller skates, or scooters in communities, expanding its application to enhance safety across various demographics.
